# dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c) [5pts]
# Write the function dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c) that takes 3 dice and
# returns them in a hand, which is a 3-digit integer. However, even if the
# dice are unordered, the resulting hand must be ordered so that the largest
# die is on the left and smallest die is on the right. For example:
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(1,2,3) == 321)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(6,5,4) == 654)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(1,4,2) == 421)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(6,5,6) == 665)
# assert(dicetoorderedhand(2,2,2) == 222)


def dicetoorderedhand(a, b, c):
	# your code goes here
	#to get the max of three digits
	ma=max(a,b,c)
	#to get the minimum from three digits
	mi=min(a,b,c)
	#to get the remaining number other than max and min
	medium=(a+b+c)-(ma+mi)
	#adding them together
	return (ma*100)+(medium*10)+mi
